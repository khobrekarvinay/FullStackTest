// CI/CD stands for:
// Continuous Integration (CI) → Automating code integration, testing, and merging.
// Continuous Deployment (CD) → Automatically deploying changes to production with minimal manual intervention.

//Q. Why is it needed ?

// Ensures faster & safer deployments.
// Helps catch bugs early with automated testing.
// Reduces manual work by automating build & deployment steps.
// Improves collaboration in team-based projects.


// Basic CI/CD Pipeline flow:

// 1.Commit:-- Developer pushes code → GitHub Actions triggers pipeline.
// 2.Build:-- Build Step runs → Installs dependencies, compiles assets.
// 3.Test:-- Tests Run → Jest, Cypress, or other testing tools.
// 4.Deploy:-- Deployment → Pushes to Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, or AWS.
// 5.Monitor:-- Monitoring & Alerts → Log errors using Sentry, Datadog.
