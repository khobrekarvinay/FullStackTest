////Q. What is Agile ? -----------

// Agile is a way of working in software development where teams:
// ✅ Work in small steps instead of trying to build everything at once.
// ✅ Get feedback regularly so they can make improvements.
// ✅ Adapt quickly if changes are needed.

// Why is Agile used?
// To deliver software faster without waiting months or years.
// To fix problems early instead of at the end of the project.
// To make sure the software meets customer needs by getting feedback often.

// Basically a minimum stress way of delivering software.


// AGILE METHODOLOGIES ------------
// All methodologies are just development practices that help teams work together more effectively. 
// Not an actual framework technology that's used in coding like Express.

// 1. SCRUM :

// Scrum is a type of Agile method that helps teams organize their work and deliver software in small, manageable parts.

// How does Scrum work?
// Imagine you're building a house. Instead of trying to build everything at once, you first build the foundation, 
// then walls, then rooms, checking progress at each step. Scrum works the same way but for software.

// Basic Flow in Scrum: -------------
// 1️⃣ Work is divided into Sprints (short cycles of 1-4 weeks). Sprints are just weeks.
// 2️⃣ The team meets daily for quick updates (Daily Standup).
// 3️⃣ After each Sprint, the team shows what they built (Sprint Review).
// 4️⃣ The team also reflects on how to improve (Sprint Retrospective).

// Why is Scrum used? 
// Keeps the team organized and focused.
// Ensures regular progress and quick adjustments.
// Helps catch mistakes early & fix them.

// Roles in Scrum: ------------
// 🏆 Product Owner – Decides what features to build.
// 🛠 Development Team – Writes code and builds the product.
// 📢 Scrum Master – Makes sure the team follows Scrum and removes any obstacles.

// Example in Real Life: Imagine you’re making a mobile app-------

// Instead of waiting 6 months to release everything, you first release a login page in 2 weeks.
// Then, in the next 2 weeks, you add a profile page.
// Every few weeks, you check with users if they like the app and make improvements.

//2. KANBAN :

// Kanban is a visual way of managing work where tasks move through different stages until they’re done. It’s like a To-Do list on a board.

// Why is Kanban Used? 
// ✅ Helps track progress visually.
// ✅ Makes work flow smoothly without overloading the team.
// ✅ Great for teams that handle ongoing tasks (e.g., bug fixes, support tickets).

// 1. Set Up a Kanban Board----
// A Kanban board is divided into columns like:
// 📌 To Do → 📌 In Progress → 📌 Review → 📌 Done
// Each task is written on a card and moves across the board.

// 2. Work on Tasks Continuously----
// There are no fixed Sprints (unlike Scrum).
// The team picks a task, works on it, and moves it to the next stage.
// Tasks flow smoothly without time-boxed cycles.

// 3. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)----
// To avoid overload, teams set a limit on how many tasks can be “In Progress” at a time.
// This keeps work focused and prevents too many tasks from piling up.

// 4. Deliver Work Anytime----
// Since there are no Sprint deadlines, teams release features as soon as they are ready.
// Good for support teams, maintenance, and continuous deployment.

// Basically, Kanban helps teams visually track and complete work continuously without strict planning or Sprints. 🚀
